**To dos** 
1.  Add a make file to build the project
2.  build lexical analyser to analyse and validate the tokens
3.  build a controller to control the inputs and outputs
4.  build a query parser and executioner that performs the operations

**Build Me**
1. create a bin in the root of the folder 
2. go to the src folder and run gcc [files that need to be compiled] -g -o ../bin/{name of the executable}
     a. Ideally this should be in a make file
